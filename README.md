## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```

This should show the version of Node.js installed. If it is not installed, download it from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/).

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaimejaramilloperez/adventjs-2023.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd adventjs-2023
```

3. Install the dependencies (optional) using the package manager of your choice (npm, pnpm, etc).

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run all tests with:

```bash
npm run challenges
```

Or run the tests for each challenge with the following command, replacing `{challenge number}` with the corresponding number:

```bash
npm run challenge{challenge number}
```

For example:

```bash
npm run challenge1 # Runs tests for challenge 1
npm run challenge3 # Runs tests for challenge 3
npm run challenge5 # Runs tests for challenge 5
npm run challenge8 # Runs tests for challenge 8
```
